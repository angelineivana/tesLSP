### Unit Testing

To ensure the reliability of the application, extensive unit testing has been implemented. The unit tests verify the correctness of individual components and cover a variety of scenarios.

#### Unit Test Details

- **Test Code Location:** All feature test cases are located in `tests/feature`.
- **Unit Test Results:** After running the tests, results are stored in the file `tests/unittest-result.xml`.
- **Testing Scenarios:** A detailed testing scenario description can be found in `tests/testing-scenario.md`.

### Running Tests

To execute the tests, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan test
```

Alternatively, to generate the test results in XML format for CI/CD integration:

```bash
php artisan test --testdox --log-junit=tests/unittest-result.xml
```

### Understanding Testing Scenarios

The testing scenarios document (`tests/testing-scenario.md`) outlines:
- Each feature being tested.
- Input and expected output for every scenario.
- Special edge cases considered during testing.

This ensures comprehensive coverage and helps identify any edge cases that need attention.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. It simplifies many common tasks used in web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides the tools required for large, robust applications.
